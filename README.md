# Insights and Predictive Modeling for British Airways: A Customer Behavior Analysis
Welcome to my repository showcasing a detailed exploration of British Airways' customer feedback complemented by a predictive model focusing on booking behaviour. From 2018 to 2023, I delved deep into customer reviews using topic modelling and sentiment analysis to extract pivotal sentiments and experiences that passengers shared about British Airways.

This work doesn't just highlight areas of customer satisfaction and concern; it also presents a predictive model that I meticulously crafted. The model is designed to anticipate customer purchase behaviour, with a special emphasis on understanding the factors leading to a completed booking. Given the severe data imbalance, my approach prioritized accurately capturing true bookings to maximize potential revenue for British Airways.
